# React Big Calendar

A plain ole' react-big-calendar.


## Use and Setup

`npm i` then `npm run start` - it'll open in your browser, localhost:3000

### notes:
clickin' on a day creates an event for that whole day, click and draggin on multiple days creates a multi-day event. if you go to the top right corner, you can view it from a month, week,  day, or schedule view and choose a time slot to create an event. 

this is built off of [react-big-calendar](https://github.com/intljusticemission/react-big-calendar)
and the starter kit [react-big-calendar-starter](https://github.com/arecvlohe/rbc-starter)
